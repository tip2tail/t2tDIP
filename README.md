### Dynamic IP Redirection Tool

This is a little tool I threw together to allow my dynamic home IP to be accessible via a sub directory URL of my web server.

No warranties expressed of implied.

## Usage

Place the contents of the PHP direcotry in your web accessible server location.

Build & run the C# application.

Add the Auth Code from the app to the `config.inc.php` file where specified.

Add a shortcut to the C# app to your Windows startup procedure.

IP will be updated regularly as requested.

## Issues

This is a simple tool that I created to serve a single purpose.  It works perfectly for what I need.  However if you want to fork and modify, please feel free under the MIT license.  It is unlikely that I will do any further work on this.
